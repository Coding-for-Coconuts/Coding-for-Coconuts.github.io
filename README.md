# Coding-for-Coconuts.github.io

Coding for Coconuts is a website developed by Morgan Fleshren, Alexa Grau, and Katherine Sanchez as part of our Software Engineering class project. 
It is a fun, free, and interactive website for middle schoolers (age range 9-13) to begin learning coding. This includes beginner coding logic as well 
as some simple coding examples. To keep the users interested, this website contains fun tasks such as problems that are interactive yet challenging. 
As the user progresses through each level, they will collect coconuts. Harder levels are worth more coconuts to reward the user accordingly. This 
project will benefit students, parents, and teachers as the users develop a basic understanding of programming through this website for free.

This website will run on most devices (smartphone, tablet, computer). 

If you choose to run the code on your local machine, the logo image in the top left of the website will not load.
If you run the website by using the website (coding-for-coconuts.github.io) you should not encounter any issues.
