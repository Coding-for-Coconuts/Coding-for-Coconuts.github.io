          <h3>What Is This Site?</h3>
          <p>Coding for Coconuts is a website developed by Morgan Fleshren, Alexa Grau, and Katherine Sanchez as part of our Software Engineering class project. It is a fun, free, and interactive website for middle schoolers (age range 9-13) to begin learning coding. This includes beginner coding logic as well as some simple coding examples. To keep the users interested, this website contains fun tasks such as problems that are interactive yet challenging. As the user progresses through each level, they will collect coconuts. Harder levels are worth more coconuts to reward the user accordingly. This project will benefit students, parents, and teachers as the users develop a basic understanding of programming through this website for free.</p>
          <h3>Who Are You?</h3>
          <p>This website is ideal for anybody wanting to dip their toes into the world of coding. This website provides a basic introduction to coding logic as well as some coding examples. Our targeted age group is 9-13 years old, however, this website is useful for anybody beginning their coding journey.</p>
          <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
          <p>This website is made by team MAK. M=Morgan, A=Alexa, and K=Katherine. We are all seniors at Santa Clara University. Two of us are Computer Science and Engineering majors, and one is a Web Design and Engineering major.</p>
          <h3>How to Begin?</h3>
          <p>Click the 'Questions' tab in the top right to begin learning, or <a href="./questions.html"> click here. </a> To keep track of your coconut collection progress, head over to the 'Coconut Counter' tab, or <a href="./coconutCounter.html"> click here.</a> If you get stuck, feel free to use the 'Solutions' tab to take a sneak peek at the answers, or <a href="./solutions.html"> click here.</a> Make sure to give each problem your best effort before looking at the questions, though! You'll only gain as much as you put in.</p>
