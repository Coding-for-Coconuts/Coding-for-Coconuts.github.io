        <problem number="6" description="This problem is very similar to the last one. In the last example, we only mentioned addition as the third element of a for-loop (i=i+1), but it is important to know that any mathematical operation will work! You can use addition, subtraction, mulitplication, and division! In the problem below, we ask that you solve it using division. Keep in mind that if we are going backwards through the numbers, your second element (i<10) will actually change to use a '>' symbol. Good luck!"></problem>
